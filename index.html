            <h1>Personality</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>Outrider for the Knights of Favonius, Amber is described as "a model for justice" by Kaeya. She fulfills her duties as an Outrider diligently, even though she's the only one left in the said platoon. She abides by the rules, except for when using her wind glider, having her gliding license revoked numerous times.
             She has an outgoing personality, as one might find her talking to strangers as if they're acquaintances. She is passionate in everything she does, may it be helping the citizens or purging hilichurls. She wishes to be as great as her grandfather, a once loyal defender of Mondstadt. Even after he disappeared, she still defends Mondstadt in his place.</p>
            <br>
            <h1>Appearance</h1>
            <hr>
            Amber has long, dark brown hair, gold eyes, and fair skin. She wears a jumper-like outfit composed of dark brown leather shorts, a red hoodie-like top, red stockings, and white thigh-high boots embellished with gold linings and symbols.
            Amber's accessories include a leather belt with two small bags, and her Pyro Vision attached, gloves, a small belt on her right thigh, and gold-framed goggles. Her most distinguishing feature is the headband with the large red bow that rests on her head, resembling the shape of bunny ears. Additionally, her Vision has two red feathers attached below it. Her outfit, 5-Star Outrider, is described to be an outrider's uniform made for maximum mobility.

            <h1>Personality</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>Bennett has had more than his fair share of hardships thanks to his extraordinarily bad luck, yet he continues to be a strong and hardworking member of the Adventurers' Guild. He is optimistic, well-behaved, and full of passion for adventuring. Despite the long and excruciating stretches of bad luck he encounters, he is also inventive, having created different solutions for the problems he faces while adventuring.
            Bennett believes his Vision is a sign from the gods: a sign that they have not given up on him, just like how the old and or retired veteran adventurers from the Guild — whom he affectionately refers to as "dads" — have not given up on him either.
            <br>
            <h1>Appearance</h1>
            <hr>
            Bennett uses the medium male model. He has pale ash-grey hair, light tan skin, and bright green eyes. It seems that he keeps getting scarred from his various misadventures and categorically terrible luck. He has a prominent scar on his left shoulder.

            <h1>Personality</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>Kaeya calls himself and Diluc "anti-heroes with attitude problems". He decided to take matters into his own hands by becoming, to his dismay and embarrassment, the "Darknight Hero" to protect Mondstadt's people.
            Diluc was once an ideal young man, dedicated to his work with Knights of Favonius. After his father's untimely demise as a result of using a Delusion, along with Inspector Eroch ordering Diluc to cover up the incident, his faith in the Knights shattered and he left the organization. 
            <br>
            <h1>Appearance</h1>
            <hr>
            Diluc is a tall and slender man with pale skin, red eyes, and bright red hair, worn in a low ponytail that extends to his mid-back. His expression usually makes him appear stern, exasperated, or unimpressed.
            Diluc wears a black dress shirt, a long white vest, and a black ascot with a red gem. Over this he dons a dark brown coat. He wears black pants which are embellished with chains on his right thigh, while his Vision is attached to a belt. Diluc also wears cuffed, dark brown boots and a pair of black gloves which he has a habit of adjusting.
            His default outfit, Darknight Blaze, is described to be a smart and tasteful suit fit for a nobleman.

            <h1>Personality</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>At first glance, Hu Tao appears to be a quirky and cheerful girl. She enjoys pranking people and despises sitting around and doing nothing, as she wishes to live her life to the fullest. Her eccentric and off-the-wall personality often leaves people with a negative impression of her, especially Qiqi, who states that she has a "punchable face" and should be stored in the fridge. In contrast, Xiao enjoys her sense of humor, finding it irritating but interesting.
             On the other hand, when handling funerals and last rites, she becomes more solemn and constantly reminds her employees to never deviate from the client's requests. Due to the importance and traditions of the parlor's duties, she expresses a distaste towards people treating her or her employees with suspicion whenever they go to work at night.
            <br>
            <h1>Appearance</h1>
            <hr>
            Hu Tao uses the medium female model. She has a fair complexion; bright scarlet eyes with white, blossom-shaped pupils; faded red makeup painted at the corners of her eyes; and long dark brown hair fading to crimson at the tips.

        <div class="text">
            <h1>Personality</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>Klee is an energetic and outgoing girl who takes after her mother, Alice. She has a particular talent for creating explosives and is not fazed by the sound of explosions. She adores anything that can blow up like her bombs, such as Amber's Baron Bunny. She acts like a typical energetic young child who loves playing with her friends. Unfortunately, her definition of playing usually involves explosives; she is particularly fond of "fish blasting", tossing bombs into lakes full of fish.
            In part due to her young age, Klee can be very naïve at times and easily confused by topics she doesn't have any context for, such as mistaking Mondstadt's wine industry for a monster, and wondering why Diluc is always grumpy, even going as far as to call him the "weird grown-up".
            <br>
            <h1>Appearance</h1>
            <hr>
            Klee uses the short female model. She has pale skin, light red eyes, pale blonde hair with a prominent cowlick, and elf ears.

            <h1>Personality</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>Thoma is known by Inazumans to be a "helper" — helping everyone out and ensuring that any issues are quickly and peacefully resolved.
                The son of an Inazuman father and Mondstadter mother, Thoma shares the traits seen in both nations' peoples; his father placed a great emphasis on loyalty, while being raised in Mondstadt meant that he could easily mingle with most people. He believes that people should happily enjoy a leisurely life and does not particularly care about his reputation, even if people speak ill of him. He originally went to Inazuma to bring his father Dandelion Wine, but after falling overboard, he ended up in Inazuma with no connections and no Mora. Despite the dangers he faced at the time, Thoma was able to make the most of his situation and eventually obtained the Kamisato Clan's trust. He is an efficient worker, resolving all of the Kamisato Clan's issues in a timely order.
            <br>
            <h1>Appearance</h1>
            <hr>
            Thoma uses the tall male model. He has green eyes, fair skin, and messy blond hair that is short except for a section at the back of his head that goes down to his shoulders.

            <h1>Personality</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>Xiangling loves cooking, having learned the art from her father. She does not have a discerning eye towards a specific type of cuisine, seeing that food is a way to expand and experiment. She will use anything for her recipes, even unconventional ingredients that would gross out others. Some of the bizarre ingredients that Xiangling uses are slimes and lizards. Even if some of the dishes are not to her liking, Xiangling will not give up and simply press on to modify or start over from scratch.
                Her unconventional cooking is what led her to acclaim in both Mondstadt and Liyue. Unlike most cooks, Xiangling is not concerned about mora, stating that food is to nourish and that the smiles on her customers' faces is more than enough for her. She dislikes having to limit herself to a specific style of cooking, seeing it as bland and unsurprising.
                Outside of cooking, Xiangling is easy to scare and is often pranked by Hu Tao.Despite disliking her pranks, Xiangling does not have a grudge towards her because she occasionally brings her gifts in return for giving her a good laugh.
            <br>
            <h1>Appearance</h1>
            <hr>
            Xiangling uses the medium female model. She has black hair cut in a bob-like fashion at the front and of unknown length at the back, golden eyes, and a pale complexion.

            <hr>
            <p>Xinyan is a fan of rock 'n' roll and returned to Liyue to spread it across the nation. Despite having difficulty in improving its reputation for many reasons, she is not discouraged and continues to play, appreciating all who come to her performances. She does not have any formal training for her music, having learned it herself on the go. As such, she is very supportive of others who show interest, even if they have no experience.
                Having a fiery personality, she likes standing out in her own way, but many consider her to be weird and/or terrifying as a result. While aware of this, her attempts to make herself more presentable to them ends up in failure.

            <h1>Personality</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>Yanfei enjoys appraisal, reading and is very knowledgeable on many topics — most notably the law, due to her career as a legal advisor. With a strong sense of justice, Yanfei does not mind traveling to help her clients should they have trouble in different parts of Liyue. She claims to have extensive knowledge of the laws of the other nations in Teyvat — though, she notes Fontaine's law to be the most difficult. She is well known by the people of Liyue for her knowledge and is considered the premier legal advisor of Liyue, a title that garners her many a client across the nation. Even Ningguang, the Tianquan of the Liyue Qixing, states that Yanfei's memorization of the law allows her to quickly close loopholes in existing laws faster than she would have been able to herself. When resolving disputes, Yanfei always gets all legal evidence beforehand to make a compelling and convincing argument.

            Yanfei uses the medium female model. She has a pale complexion, bright teal-green eyes with ovoid pupils, and salmon pink hair that goes past her shoulders and fades to a pale peach at the tips. The hair around the sides of her head is chopped short at ear length in a fringe, revealing a pair of cream colored antlers as a result of her xiezhi heritage. In addition to this, the sides of her chest, ankles, and the backs of her hands have white diamond-shaped markings that resemble scales.

            <p>Yoimiya, like the rest of her family, is loved by the people of Inazuma City for the fireworks she creates. She is also loved by children due to her friendly hands-on approach with them, as she wishes to keep them happy so they don't have to deal with the harsh realities of Inazuma for the time being. Having very few worries of her own, she can also read peoples' hearts and can tell whether or not they're hiding something deep down.
            Like her father, Yoimiya is devoted to the family business, stating that her customers' happiness is the first priority above all else. This service has amassed a massive and loyal customer base who are willing to help her out on any problems she have. She is somewhat of a fast speaker, and despite being the primary provider of fireworks, is also known to be quite reckless and unprepared, having been scolded by the city's fire brigade numerous times and noted by Amenoma Tougo to always make last-minute preparations.

            <p>An outcast since birth, Aloy grew up in a harsh mountain wilderness near the tribe that shunned her. Fostered by an expert hunter, she trained to hunt with cat-like grace and deadly accuracy – but the things she most wanted to learn, he could not teach her. Most of all, she burned to know the circumstances of her birth – who her parents were, and why she was shunned by the tribe.
                Her quest for answers swept her into a wider and more dangerous world than she ever could have imagined. She encountered strange and powerful new tribes, ancient ruins rife with mysteries, and dangerous enemies, both human and machine.Eventually she learned that her origins and destiny were deeply tied to the fate of the world itself, and fought an epic battle to save it against the evil forces of an artificial intelligence from the ancient past.
                She thought that this would be the end of her journey. But there is always more to an adventurer's tale. She has now come to Teyvat in search of a new challenges.

                Chongyun is a positive individual quite literally, as he has an excess of positive energy in him. Due to this excess in positive energy, he's vulnerable to things that warms him — fiery events, food, drinks, clothing, the sun, and even blushing. In the event he is not able to suppress those feelings, he might enter a manic state of being excited, friendly or faint. In extreme cases, he may show extreme signs of irrationality. To counter said positive energy, he always wears light-colored and light-weight clothing and usually eats cold food, though even with these methods and despite his efforts, he still has issues overcoming his unusual constitution.

She despises just about anyone who indulges in alcohol, apart from Lisa[2] and Eula.[3]
                Although Diona has the option of literally destroying the industry,[4] she chose not to, instead opting to do so by plummeting the industry's reputation by becoming a bartender and serving terrible drinks. Unfortunately for her, her long-forgotten childhood friend, the Spring Fairy, blessed her with a magic touch that makes all of her drinks delicious, regardless of how noxious the ingredients used are, and she herself is unaware of this.

She dislikes people who view her similarly to the rest of her clan due to this mistrust, which has not been forgotten. She has a habit of declaring and getting "vengeance" against her enemies to redeem her family name. She is one of the few Lawrence Clan nobles who realize that their actions against the people of Mondstadt were unjustified, rather than the other way around. As a young child, she was forced by her family to learn noble etiquette as part of an educational regime so harsh that it is considered borderline abusive.

                Ganyu has served as the non-stopping secretary of the Liyue Qixing for thousands of years. The more important the task is, the more effort she puts into it, but she also becomes increasingly nervous and is more prone to making mistakes.

His charisma and determination have earned him the admiration, respect, and favor of many people in Mondstadt — yet, his love for provoking others has also gained him the exasperation of those same people. Kaeya also enjoys putting people into high-stress situations and challenging their values, which he does to both his enemies and his allies alike. He takes pleasure in seeing the hesitation in his comrades' eyes at the moment just before they dive into battle with him, just as he takes pleasure in the look of fear in his enemies' eyes as they face off against him.

Over his right eye, he wears a gold-trimmed black eyepatch that is mostly covered by his bangs. Kaeya has not been seen without his eyepatch, but his right eye, which is functional, is implied to have a scar over it due to being wounded by Diluc during their battle after Crepus' death.

Due to her undead nature, Qiqi has a relatively dull tone of voice and cannot convey most of her emotions to others, nor does she have a sense of smell.

            <hr>
            <p>When the Traveler and Paimon first meet Nahida in the Sabzeruz Festival samsara, she was an elusive and secretive individual. She voluntarily left ruling the city to the sages, though like in cases with the samsara, she would intervene as best she could if they stepped out of line. She also suffered from very low self-esteem as a result of the way the sages treated her. However after the downfall of the sages and the cleansing of Irminsul, many of these traits have minimized or vanished. She now openly wanders around the city, when she has time, and interacts with her people and has an overall far more genuinely cheerful view of herself.

He has very sensitive ears, not being very fond of thunder or wind since they greatly affect them. He is also not fond of the desert, having suffered from heatstroke and thus claims that it's too hot for him.
                He serves as a mentor to Collei, who in turn sees him as a Master of some sorts and holds him with high regard.

She's highly respected in the Kshahrewar school for her contributions, but she still remains a Haravatat scholar and refuses any attempts to join Kshahrewar. Due to technically living longer than others in part due to the King Deshret ruins she had been trapped in, she self-identifies as a senior despite her youthful appearance and demands respect from them.

Heizou's view of the term "detective" mostly stems from his belief that one should be evil's natural enemy, as the damage had already been done despite any attempt to cover it. This caused him to split with Sango. Despite appearing "brainy" to many, Heizou is one of the Tenryou Commission's strongest doushins, using his intuition to solve cases and stop criminals in their tracks. He is also capable of subduing them in melee combat, but he tries to avoid this whenever possible as he sees it as blunt.

Due to this, Jean often exhausts herself trying to complete commissions from the locals, much to the concern of her fellow members.
                Her devotion to her duties stems from two reasons; her upbringing as a child, and Varka's teachings. Even though he consistently takes his duties lightly, his relaxed and unruly personality has contributed to her growth. She shows no resentment towards his attitude, instead vowing to ensure that the city will be more prosperous and welcoming when he returns. Her work ethic makes her well-liked by both Mondstadt's citizens, her fellow members, and is noted by other organizations. Although she prefers using peaceful methods to solve problems, she will not hesitate to use force if necessary. She has a habit of calling Diluc her senior, even well after he left the Knights. Despite this, she acknowledges that they both share the same vision of protecting Mondstadt.

He once roamed Inazuma peacefully as a modest wanderer for a good portion of his life, teaching himself bladework and picking up other skills. Never seeking luxury, he is instead easily pleased just by sleeping on a sun-warmed rock. The time he has spent outdoors makes him attuned to nature and the wind, being able to "hear" and "smell" everything around him with absolute clarity. He can sense dangers, read people and track them down in an instant no matter how well they try to conceal it. Due to this sensitivity he prefers calm weather and never stays in one place for too long, having trouble sleeping for the former[2][3] and having his skills stagnate for the latter.

Notoriously, Cyno will relentlessly pursue any individuals that try to flee his judgment, even across the desert — a trait that, in combination with his prowess as a hunter and warrior, makes escaping from Cyno nigh impossible.

She believes that humans should deal with their own problems but it all changed when the Lord of Geo retired from his duties, passing it on to the Qixing. She gained a new respect towards Rex Lapis himself, realizing the magnitude of his work to govern Liyue. As part of her so-called "self-reflection", which in reality is a way to hide the newfound respect she has for Rex Lapis, she keeps memorabilia of Rex Lapis. She was also a skeptic of Visions, viewing it as both challenge and insult and once tried to destroy it, all of her attempts failing. She'd then realized the various uses of her Vision and learned to appreciate them.

            <p>Unlike the rest of her family who work as shrine maidens, Shinobu prefers to forge her own path, having tried various trades, studying in Liyue and even joining the Arataki Gang, simply because they allow her to live how she wants — outside and enjoying various experiences, rather than being shackled to the same duties repeatedly. She's a stark contrast to the rest of her group, taking matters seriously and in a generally professional matter. She handles the gang's legal issues and gets them out of trouble and tries her best to compensate for any damages that Itto might have caused with his antics. Her professionalism is noted by the people of Hanamizaka, who go to her for advice on various matters and are left impressed as their discussions with her go smoothly and efficiently. While the gang is not on good terms with the Tenryou Commission, she gets along well with Kujou Sara, even giving up her Vision to her for the sake of their friendship.

            <p>The Raiden Shogun is a firm believer of what she believes to be eternity — a place in which everything is kept the same, regardless of what goes on. She is honorable in her conduct and is revered by the people of Inazuma.
            The Raiden Shogun exists in two forms — Ei, her true identity, and the Shogun, a puppet created by Ei to oversee Inazuma in her stead while she meditates in the Plane of Euthymia. This puppet follows a set of directives programmed into her, which are extremely difficult to modify. The Shogun is cold and stern in personality, even callous at times; she is limited in emotional expression, has no likes and dislikes, and has no need for recreation.The Shogun thinks of herself as Ei's assistant and carries out her creator's exact will, unable to act on her own volition. If her usual functions are disabled, the Shogun becomes ineffectual. Due to limited protocols as a result of Ei's initial indifference towards anything other than "eternity", the puppet is able to be manipulated by external influences. For example, the Kujou Clan and Fatui persuaded her into initiating and maintaining the Vision Hunt Decree.

He loves his wolf family, but dislikes the fact that he isn't fully like them, being an infant taken in by the leader of his pack, Andrius. While he barely sees any fellow humans traveling in Wolvendom due to its fearsome reputation, he considers the few humans he does encounter to be his friends and is willing to protect them from danger if it means sacrificing his and his pack's dinner for the night. Razor is also a quick thinker, as he is able to fix Klee's disasters whenever she goes to play in Wolvendom.

Those who speak to her note that she has a ruthless, yet efficient and stern attitude, fitting for her position in the Tenryou Commission. Her devotion to the Shogun's cause and her honorable conduct has gained her the respect of those under her command. She prefers doing everything herself when possible; compared to other Tenryou generals, she participates in battle alongside her men (and head-on attacks as a result) rather than remaining at the back.

He isn't fond of most social interactions and thus rarely travels to the city of Mondstadt unless it is to meet up with his fellow alchemists or other acquaintances. Yet he's also shown to at least be fascinated or interested in them in some way, often willingly appearing in events that have some sort of social setting going on and helping out the people around him in any way he can. While he does seem to enjoy company and seeing how people interact in a social setting, he finds relationships stressful and tiresome because of the amount of effort needed to maintain them. This doesn't mean he dislikes the relationships he has with others, he simply struggles with them and can get tired out from trying to keep track of everything to keep the relationship from falling apart. He prefers being around children, especially Klee, seeing her as a younger sister. Klee in turn sees him as an older brother figure.

He has a strong sense of camaraderie and gets along well with all of the soldiers under his command, who in turn share the same sentiment and speak to him if any issues arise, including new recruits. Kazuha describes Gorou as a person who says what is on his mind, uninhibited by others' feelings. In the heat of battle, Kokomi remarks that Gorou tends to have a habit of letting the adrenaline rush to his head, often requiring someone to keep him in check when he heads to the battlefield. While he considers himself to be mostly inexperienced due to his age, he tries his best to help out with any problems that may arise. He is comfortable speaking with others apart from Yae Miko, as the kitsune frequently talks in a manner that he finds himself completely flustered to the point that he instinctively hides from her if given the chance.

He always remembers the age-old pact between the oni tribes and never uses his strength for malicious purposes, refusing to terrorize humans and steal rewards that he hadn't claimed legitimately.

For example, Hirotatsu states that he continues to serve the Yashiro Commission to repay the generosity that he showed him and his master and it is strongly implied that Ayato was the one who inspired Thoma to the point the latter received a Vision. Ayato has stated that he highly values loyalty and obedience (hence his preference for dogs), as strongly implied that there were numerous assassinations against him in the past, hence why he values those two traits so much to protect himself from rival clans and organizations.

            <p>Tartaglia describes himself as "kind of a bad guy", living for the thrill of a fight and causing chaos. As a child, Tartaglia was frightened and hesitant, but he secretly desired to become an adventurer like the ones his father told him about as they fished together. After falling into The Abyss and meeting and training with Skirk, Tartaglia's personality drastically changed. Although he appears to relatively friendly on the surface, Tartaglia is a bloodthirsty warrior. The Abyss and his old master, Skirk, made him self-confident, solipsistic, and brash, thriving on the sensation of being alive. A warrior at heart, he constantly seeks ways to grow stronger, regardless of how he obtains said power. Tartaglia considers those who wish to become strong like him to be friends and takes pleasure in battling them on the battlefield. He lusts for combat and grows excited by fighting strong opponents, even if it could mean dying in the process. He uses bows because he is weakest with them, making his victories with them all the more exhilarating.

            <hr>
            <p>As the Divine Priestess of Watatsumi Island, Kokomi handles almost all of the affairs on the island herself. While she is not content with such a burden, having preferred to be a military advisor, she nonetheless takes the mantle to give her people the hope and happiness they deserve. Like Jean, Kokomi easily burns herself out completing her tasks and tries to keep it hidden from others to avoid worrying them. Along with handling all sorts of affairs, Kokomi is a skilled strategist that thinks of all potential scenarios and how to handle them as a result of reading plenty of military books, although she also enjoys casual reading. Kujou Sara remarks that her planning prevented the Tenryou Commission from claiming full victory over the Watatsumi Army. She continues this habit even outside of military affairs. As a result of the role she plays, she is universally beloved by her people.

            <p>Mona is an astrologist who takes her passion seriously. She is very knowledgeable in this subject in part and respects, yet also fears her master at the same time. She combines her astrology skills with hydromancy, which makes her a well-known, if still growing astrologist. In part due to her astrology, Mona can tell whether or not a person is lying, can sense their intentions from a single glance, being capable of seeing their fate and is able to accurately deduce a person's traits just from knowing what their constellation is.
            <br>
            <h1>Appearance</h1>
            <hr>Mona is a young woman with fair skin. She has pale, sea green eyes.

She is patient and helpful, guiding people through issues they have step-by-step and offering ways to relieve stress.
                She enjoys sweets, seeing them as a way to make people happy. On the other hand, she despises mushrooms; she has trauma after eating a poisonous mushroom and is unable to discern the differences between poisonous and non-poisonous mushrooms.

            <p>To most people, Xingqiu appears to be a polite young man who takes his studies seriously, but he also has a more mischievous side to him. In the presence of close friends and family, he is gregarious and chatty, but shows more restraint than his elder brother. Unlike his older sibling, who is completely devoted to the guild's success, Xingqiu is more reluctant to do so, putting him at odds with his family.
                He is good friends with Hu Tao and Chongyun, though he pranks the latter consistently. He is an avid reader and spends most of his time looking for rare books at Wanwen Bookhouse when he is not preoccupied with his duties, writing his own books from time to time, with "A Legend of Sword" being one of his books. While it did not garner the popularity he wished for in Liyue, he is unexpectedly popular in Inazuma and Fontaine after an Inazuman merchant took the book back home with them; however, Xingqiu was initially unaware of its popularity in Inazuma.

Despite this, Ningguang tolerates her general absence while Keqing appreciates her work, although the latter wonders as to where she gets her intelligence from. She employs psychological tactics to catch her targets and get all the information she needs from them.
                Outside of work, Yelan approaches life at a calm and carefree pace. She frequently enjoys napping whenever possible, but will adjust her schedule as needed for the day's tasks. When handling particularly troublesome cases, she tries to save up her energy to complete everything in a single go.
